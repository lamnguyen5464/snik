## Brief Introduction
> Based on the fundamentals of two classical games named Snake and Tetris, we come up with the idea to create the combination from both of them to create Snik.
> There are competitive modes between 2 players in both online and offline versions. There is also a single offline mode with more challenges for user to enjoy.

## Instructions
> If you play alone or play with your friends offline, you don't need to start this server.
> To start local server, please run the script below.
```
bash start_server.sh
```
> Now you can enjoy playing online mode!
